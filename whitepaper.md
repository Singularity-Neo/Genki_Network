***ATHENION QUEEN***
The Sovereign Intelligence Protocol
Whitepaper – Version 1.2
February 2026

***Executive Summary***
***Athenion Queen*** represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, transitioning from centralized, capital-intensive models to a fully decentralized Swarm Intelligence architecture. Powered by proprietary algorithms and a global network of idle computing resources (the “Worker Bees”), Genki is building and operating the “Queen AI” — a sovereign, efficient, and community-owned intelligence layer. The entire network is fueled and governed by the native $GENKI token.Our mission is to democratize access to advanced AI computation and fairly reward contributors with a scarce, utility-backed digital asset.1. Introduction: The Problem of CentralizationModern AI development is heavily concentrated in the hands of a few powerful entities that control vast computational resources, training data, and model access. This creates:Systemic fragility and single points of failure  
Information asymmetry and gatekeeping  
Vulnerability to censorship and external control  
Exclusion of individual contributors who own idle hardware

***The Athenion Protocol*** was created to break this monopoly by building a censorship-resistant, community-governed intelligence network that aligns incentives between users, contributors, and the system itself.

***2. The Solution: Swarm Intelligence Architecture***

The Genki ecosystem operates through a symbiotic relationship between a lightweight coordinating core and a massively distributed compute layer.2.1 The Queen AI (Core Intelligence)The Queen is a custom, lightweight, highly optimized foundation model responsible for:Task coordination and delegation  
Maintenance of the collective knowledge graph  
Validation of proofs of work and data integrity  
Serving as the public-facing intelligence interface

It runs in a controlled yet fully auditable environment and remains open-source.

***2.2 The Worker Bees***

(Distributed Compute Layer)Worker Bees are ordinary user devices (PCs, laptops, servers, etc.) running the lightweight Genki Worker Agent. These agents:Consume only idle CPU/GPU cycles  
Execute micro-tasks assigned by the Queen (inference, validation, gradient computation, zero-knowledge proofs, etc.)  
Operate without interfering with the host device’s primary functions

***2.3 The Honey*** 
(Value Generation)Real economic value is created when external clients (enterprises, developers, users) pay in $GENKI to:Query the Queen AI  
Submit high-priority computational tasks  
Access low-latency distributed inference

A fixed percentage of every $GENKI spent is permanently burned, introducing built-in deflationary pressure.

***3. Tokenomics: The $GENKI EconomyMetric***

Mandatory for all Queen AI queries, priority task submission, and premium features
Deflation
A percentage of $GENKI used in queries is burned forever
Governance
$GENKI holders can vote on protocol upgrades, resource allocation, and parameter changes
Worker Rewards
Distributed to Worker Bees based on validated compute contribution
Scarcity
Fixed supply with ongoing burn mechanism tied to network usage

$GENKI is not merely speculative, it has real, growing demand driven by actual network activity.4. Governance & Resilience, The Survivor ProtocolThe network is designed for long-term survival and financial discipline:

Capital deployment never exceeds 1% risk per high-conviction decision  
Strict filters exclude high-risk assets (RugScore > 150 or liquidity < $15k)  
Core veto authority prevents destructive or low-yield actions  
Full on-chain transparency of burns, rewards, and treasury movements

***5. Roadmap – The Queen’s FlightPhase***
 
Phase 1
Larva
$GENKI token launch, community formation, initial agent distribution
Phase 2
Cocoon
Closed beta of Worker Bee agent and distributed training
Phase 3
Initial Flight
Public launch of Queen AI with limited query access
Phase 4
Global Hive
Enterprise integration, IoT data streams, full network scaling

***6. Worker Incentivization & Onboarding***

***6.1 Onboarding Process***

Download and the open-source Genki Worker Agent  
Agent connects to the network and is validated by the Queen  
Device is registered as an active Worker Bee

***6.2 Contribution & Rewards***
Continuous benchmarking of work quality and complexity  
Accrued contribution credits converted to $GENKI upon official token launch  
Rewards directly proportional to verified computational effort

***7. Conclusion***

Athenion Queen is not just another AI model or speculative token.  It is the foundation of a sovereign, decentralized intelligence that belongs to its contributors — a living network where compute, data, and governance are aligned through transparent incentives.The future of artificial intelligence is not controlled by corporations.
It belongs to the swarm.Join the swarm.Official Channels:
